# Solanum

![](renders/image.png)

Solanum is a 34-key diodeless split keyboard based around Pro Micro compatible MCU modules. It features support for both wired and wireless builds and has been designed to be easily hand-assembled. The PCB is reversible and hotswap with support for Kailh Choc (v1) switches. 

The layout of Solanum differs from the typical 34-key split in that it has only one thumb key, and a reachy pinky key. Nominal key spacing is 19x18mm. All columns features a slight splay; the pinky columns are splayed more aggressively.

The top face of the switchplate (i.e., the face which is visible on the left hand side of the keyboard) features a botanical illustration of *Solanum melongena*, the eggplant.
